## In My Own Words

**The Order Of The Document Matters**  
The question was always in the back of my mind. Today I just got my answer. The order of the routes, middleware, etc DOES matter.

**View Engines**  
It became clear that you are going to have to understand view engines. I worked in Jade(Pug) first and wanted to keep that as the view engine for all the tutorial projects. The view engines I need to become familiar with once I have a firm grip on Express.
1. [Express Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
2. [Mustache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache)
3. [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)

**Core Modules**
Going through tutorials in the past they would always include 'path' or us 'fs' in the code. I couldn't quit figure out how and where these files came into play.
1. [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
1. [url](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
1. [querystring](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
1. [path](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
1. [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
1. [util](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)

**Middleware**  
There is ALOT of middleware modules out there.
1. [Express Validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator)
    An express.js middleware for node-validator. The challenge is to convert projects from the legacy usage to the most current version(v4).
